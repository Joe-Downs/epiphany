# Notes

The scrip in this directory is not polished.  It is an adaptation of scripts
that were written for
one-time uses to convert several specific shared Google Folders to
Google Team Drives.  The script definitely still contains some
hard-coded
assumptions that are certainly not true for everyone's particular
setups of shared folders / shared drives.  Additionally, since they were
intended for one-time use, they really aren't polished, or, in some
cases, complete (e.g., sometimes it was easier/faster to leave the
script incomplete and then just manually use the Google Drive web UI
to fix up what the script didn't do).
